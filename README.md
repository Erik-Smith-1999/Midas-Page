# Midas-Page
**A template for simple product catalogues**


## How to Use
1. Download all files from the main branch
2. Edit the 'allProducts' constant at the beginning of the 'script.js' file, taking care to maintain the propper structure. When adding new products, remember to place their images in the 'images' folder.
